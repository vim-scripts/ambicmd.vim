*ambicmd* is a Vim plugin to use ambiguous command.
Some plugins provide many useful command, but sometimes these are very long.
At this time, you will define the key mappings to execute these. but:

- You will have to define quite a lot of key mappings.
- You should find unused key sequence for mapping.
- Do you define a key mapping for a command only occasionally used?

This plugin expands a ambiguous command by some patterns.  For example,

  ("|" is cursor)
  " Expands to the correct name from the lowercase.
  :ref<Space>  =>  :Ref |

  " Expands from the capital letter of the command.
  :qr<Space>   =>  :QuickRun |

  " There are some commands with "NeoComplCache" prefix.
  :ncc<Space>  =>  :NeoComplCache|

This plugin does nothing by default.
You need write some settings to vimrc as follows.

  cnoremap <expr> <Space> ambicmd#expand("\<Space>")
  cnoremap <expr> <CR>    ambicmd#expand("\<CR>")
